# CardDownloader
A simple script to scrape images from wiki ( https://yugipedia.com/wiki/List_of_Yu-Gi-Oh!_BAM_cards )

First thing I did was save HTML table and convert it into a more managable Excel file. Then I formated columns so that I'm only left with links to images in question and exported to URLs.csv

Then script just loops and downloads cards one by one.
